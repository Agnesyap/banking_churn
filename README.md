This project is aim to propose a model for predicting customer churn effectively in banking via data mining approach. 

Data mining is a process of discovering patterns and relationships in the data points using certain techniques from multiple disciplines. While conducting data mining, a few phases must be involved - problem formulation, data understanding, data pre-processing, data modelling and model evaluation.

Customer churn prediction belongs to classification model in data mining as it tries to categories whether a customer churn or not. Classification model is suitable in predicting categorical target variables. In order to propose an effective model, we are going to test on a few classification model and select the model with best performance.

Models in this product are Decision Tree, Random Forest and Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

Language: Python

Data: [Bank Customer Churn dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravtopre/bank-customer-churn-dataset) downloaded from Kaggle.
